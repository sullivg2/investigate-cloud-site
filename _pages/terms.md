Investigate Cloud is a free resource created by [Geoff Sullivan](https://geoffsullivan.net). Data contained in this map was complied by Geoff and is updated on a regular basis.

## How many regions are there?
As of February 2020, there are approximately 212 public cloud regions and edge sites globally. 

The total number of regions is constantly changing as new regions and edge sites enter service.

## What data is included in the map?
The map includes the following data points about each public cloud region or edge site shown:

* Official region ID
* Region type (Public cloud region or Edge site)
* Cloud provider
* Location (city & country)
* Approximate coordinates
 
## Who sponsors this map?
Currently, the interactive map is not sponsored. If you are interested in sponsoring the map, [contact us](mailto:geoffrsullivan@gmail.com).

## What can I do on the map?
Click on any region to reveal its information. Region markers are color coded by provider. Locations with multiple provider regions will display a cluster icon. Click on the cluster icon to reveal all of the regions in that location.

You can use the search bar to enter any address or location and the map will focus in on it.

## Can I download the data to make my own map?
Currently, the data is not available for download. The long term plan is to open source all of the project code and data. Stay tuned for an announcement on this soon.

## How often do you update the map?
The map is updated on a weekly basis.
