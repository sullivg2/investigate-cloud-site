Today, Oracle has announced five new cloud regions. They have added local regions in:

* Saudi Arabia (Jeddah)
* Australia (Melbourne)
* Japan (Osaka)
* Canada (Montreal)
* The Netherlands (Amsterdam)

As of today, all of the newly announced regions are open for business and available in the Oracle Cloud Console.

Three of these new regions (Osaka, Melbourne, Montreal) provide a second site within the same country. According to Oracle, Saudi Arabia will be joined by a second region later this year.

This announcement is part of an aggressive global expansion where Oracle has opened 10 cloud regions in the last six months. With these five new regions, Oracleâ€™s Generation 2 Cloud is available in 21 fully independent locations. The company's plan is to have 36 cloud regions available by the end of 2020.
